Assignment 11

Problem 1:
Please note this returns a column vector of marginal probabilities, the probability that the sensor block is contaminated (=2), in the order a1,e1,h1,a4,h5,a8,d8,h8 (as listed on the Assignment specification sheet).

Problem 2:
Please note this returns a 8x2 vector of marginal probabilities, the probability that the sensor block is contaminated (=2), in the order a1,e1,h1,a4,h5,a8,d8,h8 (as listed on the Assignment specification sheet), given that node is not contaminated (first column) or that node is contaminated (second column).

Problem 3:
If you input a significant number of nodes, this method may take a few seconds.
Please note the input is a vector (ie GetMarginalGivenSeveral([1,2,3]);)
